'''
The wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit (called class) is known as encapsulation. Data encapsulation is the most striking feature of a class. The data is not accessible to the outside world, and only those functions, which are wrapped in the class, can access it. These functions provide the interface between the objectâ€™s data and the program. This insulation of the data from direct access by the program is called data hiding or information hiding.'''


class Encapsulation:
    __name=None
    emp_id=100887
    salary='1.5 lakh'

    def __init__(self,name):
        self.__name=name

    def display(self):
        print(self.__name)
name1=Encapsulation('Siddu')
#print(name1.__name)
print(name1.emp_id)
print(name1.salary)
name1.display()
